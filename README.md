1. Build the Sensor Library
Open vitis and build Sensor Library

2. Link the Pre-built Libraries to the Main Application
i. Ensure that the pre-built libraries are available and correctly placed. These libraries are typically built in another step or repository and should be accessible for linking.

ii. In the main applicationâ€™s CMakeLists.txt, link the sensor library and any other pre-built libraries

ex: 
add_library(isp_fw_lib STATIC IMPORTED)
set_target_properties(isp_fw_lib PROPER.TIES IMPORTED_LOCATION <path/libisp_fw_lib.a>)

add_library(sensor_lib STATIC IMPORTED)
set_target_properties(sensor_lib PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION <path/libsensor_lib.a>)

target_link_libraries(isp_fw_main.elf
  PRIVATE
    isp_fw_lib
    sensor_lib


3. Build main application
